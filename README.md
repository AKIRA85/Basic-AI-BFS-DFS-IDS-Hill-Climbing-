Hill_Climbing
=============

Hill Climbing Solutions for 8-Puzzle and N-Queens problems in C++

Simple A.I. Algorithms to solve the 8-puzzle and N-Queens problems. The purpose of this(besides fun) it's to benchmark the algorithms against each other for certain kind of problems.

    For the 8 - puzzle: BFS, DFS and IDS
  
    For the N - Queens: Greedy hill-climbing, Greedy hill-climbing with random restarts, Greedy hill-climbing 
                        with side moves and random restarts and First - Choice hill - climbing with random restarts


Compile with g++. No dependencies.
